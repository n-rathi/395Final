# About

For this project, we decided to turn Kavi into a bartender. The player may approach Kavi and ask him things you would usually ask a bartender, such as:
<ul>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>






Most of our changes were made in grammar.prolog and imperatives.prolog, near the bottom of each file. We also added info about drinks in Ontology/drinks.prolog.
